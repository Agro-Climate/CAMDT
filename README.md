==================================================
*Note(July, 2017)
1) If you are new to Python, one of the best ways to run CAMDT is to install Anaconda which help you avoid isntalling all requried modules separately.

If you have an issue with graphs, try to install an older version of Anaconda (4.1.1 version rather than 4.3.1 version or any other latest versions).

2) CAMDT uses TkInter (Python interface for GUI) and pmw widget to create graphical user-interface. You need to install pmw after installing Anaconda.
